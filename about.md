I am a full stack software developer specialising in the .NET and Microsoft Azure tech stack.<br>

After starting in Readify's Managed Services team supporting multiple customer products, I joined the Internal Delivery team. I currently work on multiple internal systems across all areas of the Readify business to support sales collaboration, recruiting, consulting, reporting, performance reviews and professional development.

In addition to developing software, I build and manage CI/CD delivery pipelines to ensure a continuous delivery of value to the end user. I work in an Agile manner and consult with all areas of the business to incorporate and integrate feedback for improvement.

The technologies that I work with include: <br>

### Early Days

After completing a double degree in Electronic & Communications Engineering and Physics at RMIT, I started my career at Telstra as a graduate. I started my journey as a Sales Associate in the Infrastructure Industry Solutions sales team working with mining companies looking to deploy LTE mobile networks across their mine sites.<br>

After seeing how the sales team operates in a larger business I decided to join Readify in order to further develop my technical & consulting skills to build useful products and systems with a hands on approach. I have been with Readify since February 2017.
